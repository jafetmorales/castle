# Medieval Castle Generator
3D print-ready medieval castle generator

v1 uploaded to Thingiverse at http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1612651


Ideas for future versions:
- Village generator
- Ground generator by combining several hills
- Add more themes, e.g. Taj Mahal, Winterfell
- Add outer decorative elements still in the 45deg slope logic: bridges, arches, etc.
- Holes for flags + seperate printing of flags

Ideas implemented:
- Wall with towers along it (e.g. Bastille) = Fortress Generator
