# Medieval Castle Generator
3D print-ready medieval castle generator

Generators are active on Thingiverse:
Castle Generator: recursive towers over a central building+towers
http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1612651

Fortress Generator: perimiter wall with towers and one generation of turrets
http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1639567

Grand Castle Generator: combination of perimiter wall + recursive towers + simple controls
http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1682427


Ideas for future versions:
- Village generator
- Ground generator by combining several hills
- Add more themes, e.g. Taj Mahal, Winterfell
- Add outer decorative elements still in the 45deg slope logic: bridges, arches, etc.
- Holes for flags + seperate printing of flags
